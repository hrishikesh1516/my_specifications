    about: "I am a Music addicted Earth Sciences undergraduate at IISER Kolkata dedicated to decoding deep-time ecological narratives. My research integrates paleobiology with computational modeling. I aspire to advance evolutionary understanding through interdisciplinary approaches in sedimentology and geochemistry. I am interested in microfossil applications for paleoenvironmental reconstruction and industrial biostratigraphy. ",
